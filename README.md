# Graphical Standings Tool

`gstool.py` provides a way to turn data from a sports league (as a pandas DataFrame) into a nice SVG graphic.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:
- **pandas**
- (Optional) pandas has some optional dependencies to use certain useful functions such as `read_excel`.

## Plans
The next new things I want to do with this project:
- Dashed lines
- Docstrings
